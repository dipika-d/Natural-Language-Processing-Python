## Text Processing
This is a collection of the text processing scripts that I write and utilise from day to day. The following are the scripts found on this directory :

* Term Frequency Word Cloud 
  * A script to parse any PDF file and output a word cloud of the 50 most frequent terms.

* Bayesian Autocorrect
  * A simple autocorrect based on Bayes Theorem inspired by Peter Norvig's Spell Checker to autocorrect an incorrectly spelt search term. 

* Corpus Build
  * A script that extracts text and compiles a corpus from a Wikipedia dump file using gensim. 

* Reddit Sentiment Analysis
  * This directory contains a web scraper that will scrape the names of the top 100 subreddits and compute the sentiment of each subreddit from the polarity of the top 100 comments in the 'hot' section.
